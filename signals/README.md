## raw sub-directory

...should include all audio files contributed to a signal catalog, ideally in a lossless format like FLAC (with suffix .flac -- or, if you want to applaud Microsoft, WAV with suffix .wav).

## processed sub-directory

...should include processed data products that were produced (and can be reproduced) from the raw audio data using code in the `code` directory.
